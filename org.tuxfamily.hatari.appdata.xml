		<p> Hatari is an Atari ST/STE/TT/Falcon emulator for GNU/Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, Windows and
			other systems which are supported by the SDL library. The Atari ST was a 16/32 bit
			computer system which was first released by Atari in 1985. Using the Motorola 68000 CPU,
			it was a very popular computer having quite a lot of CPU power at that time. Unlike many
			other Atari ST emulators which try to give you a good environment for running GEM
			applications, Hatari tries to emulate the hardware of a ST as close as possible so that
			it is able to run most of the old ST games and demos. Hatari is open source software and
			is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL).</p>
		<p>Hatari supports the emulation of most of the ST and STE hardware, including some special
			tricks like raster interrupts, border effects and PSG sample sound. A joystick can be
			emulated with the cursor keys or with a real PC joystick. Hatari also features the
			possibility to "mount" a directory of the host system as a ST drive, or to use images
			from an original Atari's hard disk.
			Hatari is also able to emulate the additional hardware of the TT or Falcon machines,
			like the Videl video chip or the DSP 56001. However, note that TT and Falcon support are
			currently still in development and experimental.</p>
